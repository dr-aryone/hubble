# Hubble

Hubble is a site to checkout what repos are currently trending on GitHub. It's using API from https://github.com/huchenme/github-trending-api as GitHub doesn't have one natively.

This is a weekend side project that I did to try out Vue, and thought it was pretty fun! You can check it out right here - hubble-vue.netlify.com

# Note:
Literally right after I pushed it and decide to deploy to Netlify, I found another service that does something Git-related too. https://github.com/SevenOutman/Hubble and this looks much much much more polished than mine (also written in Vue!) Swear it was a total coincidence haha. Do check it out there!
